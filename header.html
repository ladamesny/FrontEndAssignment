        <h2><span>&lt;header&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;footer&gt;</span> tag</h2>
        <p>The <strong><span>&lt;header&gt;</span></strong> element represents the "header" of a document or section of a document. The <strong><span>&lt;footer&gt;</span></strong></p> represents the "footer" of a document or section of a document.
        <strong><em><p>In the example we inclde the title in a <strong><span>&lt;header&gt;</span></strong> tag and the source in a <strong><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;</span></strong>.</p></em></strong>

          <strong><p>Excerpt on headers and footers from a post by Bill Lawson</p></strong>
        </header>
        <p>I was initially thrown off-course by the presentational name of the element; my use here isn't at the bottom of the page, or even at the bottom of the article, but it certainly seems to fit the bill-it's information about its section, containing author name, links to related documents (comments) and the like. There's no reason that you can't have more than one footer on page; the spec's description says "the footer element represents a footer for the section it applies to" and a page may have any number of sections. The spec also says "Footers don't necessarily have to appear at the end of a section, though they usually do."</p>
