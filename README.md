TurnToTech Front End Assigntment

Aim: Become proficient in the newer basic front end web development techniques using HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript

1. Create a website that uses each of the following in their intended way:

• HTML
• CSS	3
• Javascript

i. These tags: <article>, <aside>, <bdi>, <details>, <dialog>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <footer>, <header>, <main>, <mark>, <menuitem>,	<meter>, <nav>, <progress>, <rp>, <section>, <summary>, <time>, <audio>, <embed>, <source>, <track>, <video>, <graphic>, <svg>

ii. These input types: color, date, datetime, datetime-local, email, month, number, range, search, tel, time, url, week

i. Selectors,	RGBA with Opacity, Transform, Multicolumn Layout, Web fonts, feature detection, multiple backgrounds, flexible box model, transition, use media queries to resize for different devices, nth-child, pseudo classes

i. Load a remote image from another site asynchronously when the user presses a button. 

If the page has to reload or you are sending users to a new page, you are not doing it 
correctly. (pro-tip: google the term “AJAX”)

ii. Press the button again to get a different image from a different site, also without  reloading.

iii. Create two functions with the same name but different functionality. Put them in different namespaces so that they both be used without conflict. (pro-tip: Google the term “javascript namespaces”)
